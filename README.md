# Aubfest Website

AubFest is a local music festival in Auburn, Alabama.  It has been around for around 4 years and has cultivated a sizable number of attendees and patrons, with the festival seemingly growing exponentially every year.  
  
I was so excited to get to develop my skills in webdev by creating the official website for aubfest, and I've learned volumes already about not only the creation process, but the process of managing and maintaining a site that updates frequently.

Since at my Co-Op internship with Campus Web Solutions at Auburn University manages web applications utilizing ASPDotNet, I decided I wanted to learn a different method of developing a website.  I eventually decided the NodeJs framework lends itself well to the website's criteria/needs.

## The Technology
As previously mentioned, I built this website using the **Node.Js** framework.  I chose Node.Js due to it being very fast and scalable.
### Other technology Used
- **Express:** A lightweight web-application framework for Node.Js
- **EJS (Embedded JavaScript):** A language that lets you use HTML with plain JavaScript
    - Simmilar to how in ASP, the views are cshtml files
- **HTML & CSS:** For basic markup and style the web pages.
- **Javascript:** For client-side interractions.

## Features
- **Home Page:**
    - Anoimated 3D image carousel featuring flyers reguarding Aubfest itself and related DIY events in the Auburn community
    - Preview section for Lineup, Get  Involved, and About pages of the website
        - Each with a styled background
- **Lineup Page:**
    - Displays artists playing at the upcoming festival.  Upon hover (desktop) or single tap (mobile).  The artist's name will appear over thier image.  Clicking or touble-tapping will lead you to the artist's main source of information (instagram, linktree, official website, etc)
- **Get Involved Page:** 
    - Information and forms for various ways of getting involved with the upcoming festival, whether that be through volunteering, selling food/art, or even performing.
- **About Page:**
    - Gives useful information and FAQs reguarding the festival.  A great source of information for any first-time festival-goers
- **Responsive Design** 
    - Mobile-friendly layouts for all pages of the website
